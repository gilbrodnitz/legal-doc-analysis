### Question 3
**Q:** What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?

**A:** According to the context, the plaintiff raised three issues about the ARR (Annualized Revenue) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
2. The invoiced amounts reflected revenue from "ramping" licenses, which added more Robots in the final month or months of a license.
3. The ARR was artificially inflated because it included non-recurring revenue, such as one-time fees for implementation and service.

These issues were raised to argue that the definition of ARR was misleading because it did not reflect actual or anticipated reductions in invoiced value due to contract non-renewals or service cancellations.

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** According to the context, UiPath did not allegedly mislead investors during the IPO. The court dismissed the allegations that UiPath misrepresented its difficulties in marketing its products and competitive environment when it published the offering documents for its IPO on April 21, 2021.

Additionally, the court found that the risk factors disclosed in the Offering Documents were not misleading because they described hypothetical risks, which had already materialized. The court also dismissed allegations regarding UiPath's "land-and-expand" model, stating that none of these statements by the defendants were actionable and all have been taken out of context.

The only allegation that was not dismissed was that UiPath failed to disclose that it was hiring a Microsoft executive as its Chief Business Officer, which was revealed on March 30, 2022. However, this was not related to the IPO or the Offering Documents.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** According to the context, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because the plaintiff failed to plausibly plead that any material misstatements or omissions were made in the Offering Documents. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of misleading statements and omissions were not supported by the facts and did not demonstrate a strong inference that the defendants acted with scienter (knowledge of wrongdoing). Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiff's claims were time-barred, as they were brought more than one year after the Offering Documents became effective.

### Question 6
**Q:** What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?

**A:** According to the context, the opinion states that:

* "Rule 10b-5(b) requires 'identifying affirmative assertions' before 'determining if other facts are needed to make those statements not misleading.'" (Id. at 264)
* A statement is materially misleading when the defendants' representations, taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor. (Altimeo Asset Mgmt., 19 F.4th at 151)
* Rule 10b-5(b) does not apply to "pure omissions," which occur "when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence." (Id. at 263)

Note: The opinion is discussing the requirements for pleading a material misrepresentation or omission under Rule 10b-5 and the concept of "materially misleading" statements.

### Question 3
**Q:** What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?

**A:** According to the context, the plaintiff raised three issues about the ARR (Annualized Renewal Run-Rate) metric:

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** According to the context, UiPath did not allegedly mislead investors during the IPO. In fact, the court dismissed the allegations that UiPath misled investors regarding:

* Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR): The court found that UiPath repeatedly warned investors not to rely on ARR as an indicator of future revenue and that it was based on invoiced amounts from a particular time period.
* "Land-and-Expand" business model: The court dismissed the allegations that UiPath's statements about its land-and-expand model were misleading, finding that the statements were taken out of context and did not plausibly plead that the prospectus statement was misleading.

The court also found that UiPath made fulsome disclosures about its financial condition and risk factors, which were not incomplete or misleading. Therefore, investors were at liberty to consider ARR figures as well as traditional GAAP metrics.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** The court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were time-barred. The plaintiff brought the claims in 2024, but the statute of limitations period on a ยง 11 claim had run by then.

### Question 6
**Q:** What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?

**A:** According to the context, the opinion states that:

* To state a claim for material misrepresentations or omissions under Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must plead (1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.
* The SAC does not plausibly plead that any statements were made in the Offering Documents that were false or misleading, so all that remains is the plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents in violation of a duty to disclose.
* Rule 10b-5(b) requires "identifying affirmative assertions" before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading."
* The opinion does not address the argument that the ยง 11 claim is untimely.

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** According to the context, UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by:

1. Using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR), to suggest that its financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. Claiming that its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not.
3. Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation.
4. Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** The court dismissed the Section 11 claims because the plaintiff did not plausibly plead that any misstatements were made in the Offering Documents, and therefore, all that remains of the ยง 11 claim is the plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents in violation of a duty to disclose. The court also found that the plaintiff's reliance on American Pipe tolling fails because the original complaint did not plead a ยง 11 claim, and no reasonable plaintiff seeking to lead a class could have reasonably relied on that complaint as tolling the ยง 11 statute of limitations.

### Question 1
**Q:** What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?

**A:** Based on the excerpts, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that UiPath's Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions, which led to a failure to disclose known trends or uncertainties that had already materialized. The plaintiff specifically alleges that the defendants failed to disclose problems competing with Microsoft since 2020, which artificially inflated the price of UiPath's stock during the class period.

The excerpts suggest that the plaintiff is arguing that the Offering Documents contained false or misleading statements regarding ARR, the land-and-expand program, and risk factors, as well as omissions of material information. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants failed to disclose a known trend or uncertainty that had already materialized, namely UiPath's struggles competing with Microsoft since 2020.

The excerpts further suggest that the plaintiff is relying on cases such as Green v. Dep't of Educ. of N.Y., Vengalattore v. Cornell Univ., and Melendez v. City of N.Y. to support its allegations, and that it is arguing that the defendants' statements artificially inflated the price of UiPath's stock during the class period.

Overall, the core allegation made by the plaintiff appears to be that the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions that led to a failure to disclose known trends or uncertainties that had already materialized, which in turn artificially inflated the price of UiPath's stock.

### Question 3
**Q:** What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?

**A:** Based on the excerpts, the plaintiff raised several issues about the ARR (Annualized Revenue) metric:

1. **Artificially inflated**: The plaintiff argued that the ARR metric was "artificially inflated" because it included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
2. **Misleading definition**: The plaintiff claimed that the definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than GAAP metrics, without disclosing its limitations.
3. **Invoiced amounts not reflective of actual revenue**: The plaintiff argued that the invoiced amounts included in ARR did not reflect actual or anticipated reductions in invoiced value due to contract non-renewals or service cancellations.

These issues were raised as part of the plaintiff's securities fraud claims against UiPath, alleging that the company made false and misleading statements about its financial performance and growth.

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by making statements that were later revealed to be inaccurate or misleading. Specifically:

* The SAC alleges that UiPath misrepresented the difficulties it was encountering in marketing its products and its competitive environment when it published the offering documents for its IPO.
* The SAC also alleges that UiPath's statements regarding its "land-and-expand" business model, which described how customers had historically expanded their use of UiPath's platform, were misleading because customers had actually stopped renewing and expanding their licenses by the time of the IPO.
* The SAC further alleges that UiPath's risk factors disclosed in the offering documents and subsequent SEC filings were misleading because two of the risks that had already materialized were described as hypothetical risks.

The court's opinion suggests that these allegations are sufficient to support an inference that the defendants, including Dines and Gupta, had the requisite scienter when making the actionable statements. However, the court also notes that the SAC has not plausibly pleaded that the prospectus statement regarding UiPath's "land-and-expand" model was misleading.

Overall, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by making statements that were later revealed to be inaccurate or misleading, and that these statements had a material impact on the price of its stock.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because the plaintiff failed to plausibly plead that any material misstatements or omissions were made in the Offering Documents. The court found that the plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents was not supported by the facts.

The court specifically noted that the plaintiff did not allege scienter, reliance, or loss causation, which are required to state a claim under Section 11. Additionally, the court found that the plaintiff's claims were time-barred, as they were brought more than one year after the Offering Documents were filed.

The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the Securities Act claims related back to the original complaint, citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Macquarie, which held that a substituted plaintiff cannot amend the pleading to file a claim that had not been previously pleaded and was time-barred at the time it was first filed.

Overall, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were not supported by the facts and were time-barred.

### Question 6
**Q:** What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that:

* Under Rule 10b-5(b), a statement or omission is material if "a reasonable investor would have considered it important in deciding whether to buy or sell the security." (Altimeo Asset Mgmt. v. Qihoo 360 Tech. Co. Ltd., 19 F.4th at 151)
* A statement is materially misleading when the defendants' representations, taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor. (Id.)
* Rule 10b-5(b) requires "identifying affirmative assertions" before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." (Id. at 264)
* A statement or omission is not considered a violation of Rule 10b-5(b) simply because it is silent on a particular topic, as long as the silence does not render the statement made misleading. (Id. at 265)

Overall, the opinion emphasizes that materiality and scienter are essential elements in determining whether a statement or omission violates Rule 10b-5(b).
