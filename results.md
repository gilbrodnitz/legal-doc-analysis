### Question 1
**Q:** What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants violated § 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the risk factors disclosed in the Offering Documents were misleading because two of the risks which had already materialized were described as hypothetical risks.

### Question 3
**Q:** What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annualized Renewal Run-Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may not renew their licenses.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than GAAP metrics.

The plaintiff argued that these issues made the ARR metric artificially inflated, which led to a misleading representation of UiPath's financial outlook.

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** Based on the excerpts, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO in several ways:

1. Misleading metric: The SAC (Securities Class Action) alleges that UiPath used a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate ("ARR"), to suggest that its financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. "Land-and-Expand" business model: The SAC claims that UiPath claimed its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not. This model involves attempting to "land" new customers and then "expand" those customers' use of UiPath products.
3. Understating competitive threats: The SAC alleges that UiPath understated the competitive threats it faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft").
4. Misleading risk disclosures: The SAC claims that UiPath's risk disclosures were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on statements made by UiPath in its offering documents, quarterly and annual filings with the SEC, press releases, and conference calls with investors.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** Based on the provided excerpts, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead any material omission from the Offering Documents.
2. The limitations period began when "a reasonable investor conducting a timely and diligent inquiry would have discovered the untrue statement or omission." (15 U.S.C. § 77m)
3. The plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents in violation of a duty to disclose was not supported by the pleadings.
4. The court held that American Pipe tolling could not extend the statute of repose contained within § 13 of the Securities Act, and therefore, the plaintiff's reliance on American Pipe tolling fails.

The court also noted that because there is no Section 11 claim, plaintiffs will have the burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things; the defendants will not face a strict liability claim. Additionally, the court cited Macquarie, which held that Section 11 imposes absolute liability on the issuer of a registration statement if certain conditions are met, but does not create liability for failure to speak on a subject at all.

Overall, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were untimely and lacked sufficient pleading to support the allegations.

### Question 6
**Q:** What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that:

* A statement is materially misleading when the defendants' representations, taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor (Altimeo Asset Mgmt. v. Qihoo 360 Tech. Co. Ltd., 19 F.4th at 151).
* To state a claim for material misrepresentations or omissions under Rule 10b-5(b), a plaintiff must plead: (1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation (In re Phillip Morris Int’l Inc. Sec. Litig., 89 F.4th at 417).
* Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to "omit material facts in connection with the sale of any security when that omission renders statements made misleading" (Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. at 259).
* A pure omission under Rule 10b-5(b) occurs when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence (Id. at 263).

Overall, the opinion emphasizes the importance of materiality and scienter in establishing a claim for material misrepresentations or omissions under Rule 10b-5(b).

### Question 1
**Q:** What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants (UiPath's management) made misleading statements and omissions in the Offering Documents, which masked UiPath's difficulties in gaining and retaining customers and the impact of competitors such as Microsoft. The plaintiff alleges that these misstatements and omissions violated Section 11 of the Securities Act, which requires companies to make a "full and fair disclosure of information" in connection with a public offering.

The specific allegations include:

* Misleading use of the Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR) metric to suggest that UiPath's financial outlook was stronger than it actually was
* Claiming that UiPath's "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not
* Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation
* Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical

The plaintiff argues that these misstatements and omissions caused investors to make decisions based on false or incomplete information, resulting in economic loss.

### Question 2
**Q:** Who were the defendants in this case?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the defendants in this case are:

* Daniel Dines, who served as the Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors and CEO
* Ashim Gupta, UiPath's CFO
* The two individual defendants (Dines and Gupta) are also referred to collectively as "the defendants" or "defendants".

Justification:
The answer is supported by excerpts from the SAC (Securities Class Action Complaint), which identifies Daniel Dines and Ashim Gupta as the two individual defendants. Additionally, the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants refers to them collectively as "the defendants".

### Question 3

**A:** The plaintiff raised several issues about the ARR (Annualized Renewal Run-Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may choose not to renew licenses.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than the GAAP metrics.

The plaintiff argued that these issues made the ARR metric artificially inflated and therefore misleading to investors.

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by:

1. Using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR), which suggested that the company's financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. Claiming that its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not.
3. Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation.
4. Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on the SAC's claims that the defendants' statements artificially inflated the price of UiPath's stock during the Class Period. The SAC asserts that these misrepresentations were made in the Offering Documents and subsequent SEC filings, and that they were not corrected until later in the Class Period when partial disclosures were made.

The excerpts also suggest that UiPath repeatedly warned investors about the limitations of ARR as a metric for future revenue, but this did not prevent the plaintiff from alleging that the company's use of ARR was misleading.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** Based on the provided excerpts, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims due to the following reasons:

1. The plaintiff did not plead that she purchased shares traceable to the allegedly defective registration statement, as required by Slack Technologies, LLC v. Pirani, 598 U.S. 759, 770 (2023).
2. The original complaint filed in September of 2023 did not plead a Section 11 claim, and therefore, American Pipe tolling fails.
3. The statute of limitations period on the Section 11 claim had run, and the defendants were entitled to rely on that fact and assess their litigation risks accordingly.

The court held that the plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents in violation of a duty to disclose was not sufficient to state a plausible claim under Section 11. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not dispute the accuracy of the transcript of the March 30, 2022 Earnings Call, which identified Dines as the speaker, and that several allegations in the SAC about competition with Microsoft were too general or untethered to any date.

In summary, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims due to the plaintiff's failure to plead a plausible claim, the lack of standing to bring such a claim, and the expiration of the statute of limitations period.

### Question 6
**Q:** What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?

**A:** Based on the provided excerpts from the legal document, specifically the Opinion in In re UiPath, Inc. Securities Litigation, I conclude that:

The opinion holds that the plaintiff's claims of Rule 10b-5(b) violations fail to plausibly plead that the defendants' statements regarding competition with Microsoft were misleading.

Justification:
The opinion states that several allegations in the SAC about competition with Microsoft are too general to be inconsistent with the statements by Dines cited above. Other allegations are untethered to any date. The opinion also notes that the defendants argue that Dines was merely expressing corporate optimism and that in their SEC filings and at other conferences, the company disclosed that Microsoft was a competitor. These arguments fail.

The opinion further states that the plaintiff has failed to explain why UiPath was not free to develop a bespoke measurement tool and describe that tool to investors so long as it did so accurately. The fact that management used ARR as a "key" metric and believed it was a useful tool to measure customer commitment period-over-period, as Gupta explained to investors on December 8, 2021, does not state a violation of the securities laws.

Overall, the opinion concludes that the plaintiff's claims of Rule 10b-5(b) violations fail to plausibly plead that the defendants' statements regarding competition with Microsoft were misleading.

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annualized Revenue Run Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may choose not to renew licenses.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.

These issues were raised in the SAC (Statement of Alleged Claims) and are discussed in the Opinion excerpts provided.

### Question 4
**Q:** How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?

**A:** Based on the provided excerpts, it appears that the SAC (Securities Class Action) alleges that UiPath misled investors during the IPO by making four sets of misrepresentations:

1. Statements concerning ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): The SAC claims that UiPath's statements about ARR were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial performance.
2. Statements concerning "land-and-expand" business model: The SAC alleges that UiPath's statements about its ability to expand its business and increase revenue from existing customers were misleading, as the company was actually experiencing difficulties in this area.
3. Statements regarding competitors, particularly Microsoft: The SAC claims that UiPath's statements about its competitive position and market share were misleading, as the company was struggling to compete with Microsoft and other rivals.
4. Risk factors identified in SEC filings: The SAC alleges that the risk factors disclosed by UiPath in its SEC filings were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial condition or business performance.

However, based on the excerpts provided, it appears that the court has dismissed some of these claims, finding that:

* The statements about ARR were not misleading, as UiPath warned investors not to rely solely on this metric and provided GAAP-compliant financial results.
* The statements about the "land-and-expand" business model were taken out of context and did not state a violation of securities laws.
* The risk factors disclosed by UiPath in its SEC filings were not misleading, as they accurately reflected the company's financial condition and business performance.

Therefore, it appears that the court has granted the motion to dismiss some of the plaintiff's claims, finding that UiPath did not mislead investors during the IPO.

### Question 5
**Q:** What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were time-barred. The plaintiff did not plead a Section 11 claim within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.

The court held that American Pipe tolling does not permit the filing of an amended class action complaint in 2024 containing a time-barred Section 11 claim. The original complaint, filed in September 2023, did not plead a Section 11 claim. Therefore, the lead plaintiff's Section 11 claim, brought on behalf of the class, is dismissed as time-barred.

The court also noted that the plaintiff does not allege that the Offering Documents contained any additional misleading statements in violation of Section 11 apart from those already discussed in connection with his Exchange Act claims. The Exchange Act claims based on alleged misrepresentations in the Offering Documents have already been dismissed.

### Question 6
**Q:** What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?

**A:** Based on the provided excerpts from Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S, here is my analysis:

The opinion discusses Rule 10b-5(b) and its application to the case at hand. The key points are:

1. Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omission renders statements made misleading (Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. 257, 259 (2024)).
2. The rule does not apply to "pure omissions," which occur when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence (Id. at 263).
3. Even a duty to disclose certain information does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b) (Id. at 265). Instead, the rule requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading" (Id. at 264).

In the context of this case, the opinion notes that the plaintiff does not challenge the accuracy of UiPath's reported financial information and does not assert that the ARR figures appearing in the Company's SEC filings were false. Instead, the plaintiff argues that the ARR metric itself was "artificially inflated" for three reasons.

Therefore, based on these excerpts, I conclude that:

**Answer:** The opinion states that Rule 10b-5(b) requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." It also notes that the plaintiff's claims do not challenge the accuracy of UiPath's reported financial information and does not assert that the ARR figures appearing in the Company's SEC filings were false.

### Question 7
**Q:** When was the lawsuit filed and who was appointed lead plaintiff?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

Justification:

The relevant excerpt is: "This action was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action... As required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), the plaintiff published notice of the filing on September 6. By November 6, seven applications to be appointed lead plaintiff had been filed. On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

This excerpt clearly states that the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 and that Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

### Question 8
**Q:** What happened on September 27, 2022?

**A:** Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that on September 27, 2022, UiPath hosted an Analyst/Investor day, during which Robert Enslin stated that "[w]e haven't been efficient in how we sell, and we aren't delivering the platform... in ways that clearly in, and may continue to result in, pricing pressures." This statement suggests that UiPath was experiencing difficulties in its business operations, including inefficiencies in sales and potential pricing pressures.
