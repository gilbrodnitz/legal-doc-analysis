**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 65.69s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is not explicitly stated in these excerpts. However, we can infer that the plaintiff alleged some kind of securities violation or misrepresentation by UiPath and its executives, as the defendants have moved to dismiss each of the plaintiff's claims.

The excerpts do mention specific legal theories, such as ยง 11 claim, scienter, reliance, and strict liability, which suggests that the plaintiff may have alleged some form of securities fraud or misrepresentation. However, without further information from the complaint or other relevant documents, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific core allegation made by the plaintiff.

Therefore, I would answer this question with: "The core allegation made by the plaintiff is not explicitly stated in these excerpts."

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 3.63s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the defendants in this securities litigation are:

* UiPath
* Two of its executives

This is stated in the first sentence: "This securities litigation was filed in 2023 against UiPath and two of its executives."

The motion to dismiss is being made by these defendants, and the court has granted the motion in part.

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 12.00s | Retrieved chunks: 4 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 1000*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised an issue with the Automated Revenue Recognition (ARR) metric used by UiPath in its filings with the SEC. Specifically, the plaintiff faulted UiPath for adopting a unique measure of its operations (ARR) and not providing a clear explanation of why it was using this metric instead of reporting GAAP-compliant financial results.

The plaintiff's argument is that ARR is not a reliable indicator of future revenue and that investors should not rely on it as an indicator of the company's expected results. The plaintiff also pointed out that UiPath repeatedly warned investors that ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, but rather a measure of customer commitment period-over-period.

However, the court found that the plaintiff failed to explain why UiPath was not free to develop and use a bespoke measurement tool (ARR) as long as it did so accurately. The court also noted that the prospectus statement at issue is immediately illustrated by data which the plaintiff does not challenge as inaccurate, and that the graph in the prospectus shows six years of growth in ARR data.

Therefore, the key issue raised by the plaintiff is the reliability and accuracy of the ARR metric used by UiPath to measure its operations.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 16.02s | Retrieved chunks: 8 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2000*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that the plaintiff alleges that UiPath misled investors during the IPO by using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate ("ARR"), to suggest that the company's business was growing and performing well. The plaintiff claims that ARR was not an accurate measure of revenue and did not reflect the actual financial performance of the company.

The excerpts suggest that the plaintiff alleges that UiPath failed to disclose material problems with its business, including competition from other companies in the robotic process automation software market, which resulted in pricing pressures and negatively impacted the company's financial condition. The plaintiff also claims that UiPath's use of ARR was misleading because it did not accurately reflect the company's revenue or future prospects.

The court's analysis suggests that the plaintiff has failed to plead a plausible claim that UiPath's statements were misleading. The court notes that UiPath made fulsome disclosures about its financial condition and risk factors, including competition in the market, which would have allowed investors to track whether revenue was adversely affected by these factors. The court also points out that UiPath repeatedly warned investors not to rely on ARR as an indicator of future or expected results.

Therefore, based on the excerpts provided, it appears that the plaintiff's allegations of misrepresentation during the IPO are unfounded and lack merit.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 10.61s | Retrieved chunks: 1 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 250*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, I will analyze the relevant information and provide an answer supported by the given text.

The question asks about the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims. To find the answer, I will review the excerpts carefully and identify key points related to this topic.

Excerpt:
"For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part."

This excerpt does not directly address the dismissal of Section 11 claims. However, it implies that there are specific reasons stated elsewhere in the document that support the court's decision to grant the defendants' motion to dismiss some or all of the plaintiff's claims.

To find the relevant information, I will look for subsequent excerpts that discuss the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims.

Unfortunately, no additional excerpts were provided. Therefore, without more context, it is not possible to determine the specific reasons why the court dismissed the Section 11 claims.

In the absence of further information, my answer would be:

"I am unable to provide a supported conclusion because the necessary information is missing."

Please note that this response does not imply that there are no reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims. It simply means that without additional context, it is impossible to determine the specific reasons cited by the court.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 7.12s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that because there is no ยง 11 claim, plaintiffs will have the burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things. This suggests that the opinion is discussing the requirements for a Rule 10b-5 violation.

The relevant excerpt is:

"Because there is no ยง 11 claim, plaintiffs will have the burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things; the defendants will not face a strict liability claim."

This statement implies that the court is requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate both scienter (knowledge or intent) and reliance in order to establish a Rule 10b-5 violation.

---

**Q: When was the lawsuit filed and who was appointed lead plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 6.10s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the provided excerpt, I can answer the question as follows:

The lawsuit was filed in 2023 against UiPath and two of its executives. The relevant information is found in the first sentence: "This securities litigation was filed in 2023 against UiPath and two of its executives."

As for who was appointed lead plaintiff, there is no mention of this in the provided excerpt. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to that part of the question.

Justification:

The relevant information about the lawsuit's filing date can be found in the first sentence: "This securities litigation was filed in 2023 against UiPath and two of its executives."

---

**Q: What happened on September 27, 2022?**
*Processing time: 7.15s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, there is no mention of an event occurring on September 27, 2022. The excerpts discuss various events and statements made by UiPath executives, as well as the company's financial performance, but do not specifically mention a date in September 2022.

Therefore, I would answer that nothing happened on September 27, 2022, based on the provided information.

### Model: all-minilm-l6-v2

**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 25.57s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants violated Section 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions.

The relevant excerpts are:

* The plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated ยง 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions.
* Section 11 provides in pertinent part: "In case any part of the registration statement, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement or a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring such security may sue." 15 U.S.C. ยง 77k(a).
* The Securities Act requires that "companies issuing securities make a 'full and fair disclosure of information' in connection with a public offering." New England Carpenters Guaranteed Annuity and Pension Funds v. DeCarlo, 80 F.4th 158, 168 (2d Cir. 2023), amended and superseded on rehearing, --- F.4th ---, 2023 WL 11965444 (Oct. 3, 2024) (citing Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 646 (1988)).

Therefore, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants failed to provide a "full and fair disclosure of information" in connection with the public offering, resulting in material misstatements and omissions in the Offering Documents.

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 14.84s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the defendants in this case are:

UiPath, Inc., Daniel Dines, and Ashim Gupta.

These individuals are mentioned as the defendants who have moved to dismiss each of the plaintiff's claims. The motion is granted in part, and the court has ruled that the defendants will not be exposed to a claim that the Offering Documents contained a pure omission, citing the Supreme Court's recent ruling in Macquarie.

Justification:

The relevant excerpt states: "This securities litigation was filed in 2023 against UiPath and two of its executives. The defendants have moved to dismiss each of the plaintiffโs claims." This indicates that the defendants are UiPath, Inc., and two of its executives, namely Daniel Dines and Ashim Gupta.

Additionally, the court's ruling on the motion to dismiss specifically mentions these three defendants: "The defendants will not be exposed to a claim that the Offering Documents contained a pure omission. 601 U.S. at 266." This further supports the conclusion that the defendants are UiPath, Inc., Daniel Dines, and Ashim Gupta.

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.97s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: The plaintiff raised several issues about the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, such as from "ramping" licenses that added more Robots in the final month or months of a license.
2. The ARR metric was artificially inflated because it included non-recurring revenue, such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than GAAP metrics.

These issues were raised in the SAC (Statement of Alleged Claims) and were addressed by the court in this opinion.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 14.40s | Retrieved chunks: 2 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 500*

A: Based on the excerpts, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by failing to disclose the difficulties it was encountering in marketing its products and competitive environment at the time of the offering. This is inferred from the following points:

* The plaintiff alleges that UiPath misrepresented the difficulties it was encountering in marketing its products and competitive environment when it published the Offering Documents for its IPO on April 21, 2021.
* The Offering Documents stated that "markets in which we participate are competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed." However, this language did not provide a complete picture of the challenges UiPath was facing at the time.

The excerpts suggest that the truth about UiPath's difficulties began to emerge over time, starting with partial disclosures in June 2021. This implies that investors were initially misled by the Offering Documents and only later became aware of the challenges UiPath faced.

Therefore, the answer is:

UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by failing to disclose the difficulties it was encountering in marketing its products and competitive environment at the time of the offering.

Justification: The excerpts suggest that the plaintiff's allegations are based on the idea that the Offering Documents did not provide a complete picture of the challenges UiPath faced, and that this information only began to emerge over time. This implies that investors were initially misled by the Offering Documents and only later became aware of the difficulties UiPath was facing.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 17.04s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead any material omission from the Offering Documents.
2. The original complaint, filed in September of 2023, did not plead a ยง 11 claim, and therefore, the statute of limitations period had run, making the claim time-barred.
3. American Pipe tolling fails to revive the time-barred claim because it cannot extend the statute of repose contained within ยง 13 of the Securities Act.

The court also noted that the plaintiff's reliance on cases permitting the substitution of a named plaintiff to cure a standing defect was misplaced, as those cases did not involve a substituted plaintiff bringing a previously unpleaded and time-barred claim.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 20.26s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that:

* Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omission renders statements made misleading. (Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. at 259)
* A "pure omission" under Rule 10b-5(b) occurs when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence. (Id. at 263)
* Even a duty to disclose certain information does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b). Rather, Rule 10b-5(b) requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." (Id. at 264)

In summary, the opinion clarifies that a violation of Rule 10b-5(b) occurs when there is an omission of material facts that renders statements made misleading, and not just because of a duty to disclose information.

**Q: When was the lawsuit filed and who was appointed lead plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 16.84s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

Justification:

The relevant excerpt is: "This action was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action... As required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (โPSLRAโ), the plaintiff published notice of the filing on September 6. By November 6, seven applications to be appointed lead plaintiff had been filed. On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

This excerpt clearly states that the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023 and that Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

---

**Q: What happened on September 27, 2022?**
*Processing time: 8.95s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, there is no mention of any event occurring on September 27, 2022. The excerpts primarily discuss UiPath's earnings conference calls, financial results, and presentations at various conferences during the Class Period (which appears to be a period of time prior to the filing of the securities litigation in 2023). There is also discussion about the motion to dismiss certain claims brought by the plaintiff.

Therefore, I would answer that there is no information provided regarding what happened on September 27, 2022.

**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 13.03s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants violated ยง 11 of the Securities Act because the Offering Documents contained material misstatements and omissions. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the risk factors disclosed in the Offering Documents were misleading because two of the risks which had already materialized were described as hypothetical risks.

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 7.29s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the defendants in this case are:

* UiPath
* Daniel Dines (Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors and CEO)
* Ashim Gupta (CFO)

These individuals are mentioned as being sued by the plaintiff for allegedly violating various securities laws, including Section 11 of the Securities Act.

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 14.76s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annualized Revenue Run Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, such as revenue from "ramping" licenses, which added more Robots in the final month or months of a license.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue, such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than GAAP metrics.

The plaintiff argued that these issues made the ARR metric artificially inflated and not a reliable indicator of future revenue.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 17.95s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO in several ways:

1. Misleading metric: The SAC (Securities Class Action) alleges that UiPath used a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate ("ARR"), to suggest that its financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. "Land-and-Expand" business model: The SAC claims that UiPath claimed its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not. This model involves attempting to "land" new customers and then "expand" those customers' use of UiPath products.
3. Understating competitive threats: The SAC alleges that UiPath understated the competitive threats it faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft").
4. Misleading risk disclosures: The SAC claims that UiPath's risk disclosures were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on statements made by UiPath in its offering documents, quarterly and annual filings with the SEC, press releases, and conference calls with investors.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 21.68s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead any material omission from the Offering Documents.
2. The limitations period began when "a reasonable investor conducting a timely and diligent inquiry would have discovered the untrue statement or omission." (15 U.S.C. ยง 77m)
3. The plaintiff's assertion that the defendants omitted material information from the Offering Documents in violation of a duty to disclose was not supported by the pleadings.
4. The court held that American Pipe tolling could not extend the statute of repose contained within ยง 13 of the Securities Act, and therefore, the plaintiff's reliance on American Pipe tolling fails.

The court also noted that because there is no Section 11 claim, plaintiffs will have the burden of proving scienter and reliance, among other things; the defendants will not face a strict liability claim. Additionally, the court cited Macquarie, which held that Section 11 imposes absolute liability on the issuer of a registration statement if certain conditions are met, but does not create liability for failure to speak on a subject at all.

Overall, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were untimely and lacked sufficient pleading to support the allegations.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 23.53s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the opinion states that to state a claim for material misrepresentations or omissions under Rule 10b-5(b), a plaintiff must plead:

1. A material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant;
2. Scienter (i.e., the defendant acted with the required state of mind);
3. A connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security;
4. Reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission;
5. Economic loss; and
6. Loss causation.

The opinion also notes that Rule 10b-5(b) requires "identifying affirmative assertions" before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." Additionally, the opinion states that a statement is materially misleading when the defendants' representations, taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor.

Furthermore, the opinion holds that American Pipe tolling cannot extend the statute of repose contained within ยง 13 of the Securities Act. It also rebuffs the effort to use the relation-back doctrine under Rule 15(c) to permit members of a putative class "who are not named parties, to intervene in the class action as named parties in order to revive claims that were dismissed from the class complaint for want of jurisdiction."

In summary, the opinion emphasizes the importance of pleading material misrepresentations or omissions with particularity and highlights the requirements for establishing a Rule 10b-5(b) violation.

**Q: When was the lawsuit filed and who was appointed lead plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 12.82s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts, the lawsuit was filed on September 6, 2023, by Samhita Gera as a putative class action. Paul Severt was later appointed as lead plaintiff on December 1, 2023.

Justification:

The relevant excerpt is: "This action was filed on September 6, 2023 by Samhita Gera as a putative class action... By November 6, seven applications to be appointed lead plaintiff had been filed. On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

**Q: What was the core allegation made by the plaintiff?**
*Processing time: 19.36s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the core allegation made by the plaintiff is that the defendants (UiPath's management) made misleading statements and omissions in the Offering Documents, which masked UiPath's difficulties in gaining and retaining customers and the impact of competitors such as Microsoft. The plaintiff alleges that these misstatements and omissions violated Section 11 of the Securities Act, which requires companies to make a "full and fair disclosure of information" in connection with a public offering.

The specific allegations include:

* Misleading use of the Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR) metric to suggest that UiPath's financial outlook was stronger than it actually was
* Claiming that UiPath's "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not
* Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation
* Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical

The plaintiff argues that these misstatements and omissions caused investors to make decisions based on false or incomplete information, resulting in economic loss.

**Q: Who were the defendants in this case?**
*Processing time: 9.92s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the defendants in this case are:

Daniel Dines, who served as the Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors and CEO, and Ashim Gupta, UiPath's CFO.

Justification:

The excerpts mention that the SAC (the complaint) asserts claims against "the defendants" without specifying their names. However, it is later clarified in the excerpts that the two individual defendants are Daniel Dines and Ashim Gupta, who served as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of UiPath, respectively, and CFO of UiPath.

Specifically, excerpt 2 states: "The two individual defendants are Daniel Dines, who served as the Chairman of UiPath's Board of Directors (the 'Board') and the CEO of UiPath, and Ashim Gupta, UiPath's CFO."

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.04s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: The plaintiff raised several issues about the ARR (Annualized Renewal Run-Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may choose not to renew licenses.
2. The invoiced amounts were inflated because they included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than the GAAP metrics.

The plaintiff argued that these issues made the ARR metric artificially inflated and therefore misleading to investors.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 17.70s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that UiPath allegedly misled investors during the IPO by:

1. Using a misleading metric, Annualized Renewal Run-Rate (ARR), which suggested that the company's financial outlook was stronger than it actually was.
2. Claiming that its "land-and-expand" business model was successful when it was not.
3. Understating the competitive threats that UiPath faced in the RPA market, especially from Microsoft Corporation.
4. Issuing risk disclosures that were misleading because they framed events that had already occurred as merely hypothetical.

These allegations are based on the SAC's claims that the defendants' statements artificially inflated the price of UiPath's stock during the Class Period. The SAC asserts that these misrepresentations were made in the Offering Documents and subsequent SEC filings, and that they were not corrected until later in the Class Period when partial disclosures were made.

The excerpts also suggest that UiPath repeatedly warned investors about the limitations of ARR as a metric for future revenue, but this did not prevent the plaintiff from alleging that the company's use of ARR was misleading.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 18.53s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims are:

1. The plaintiff did not plausibly plead that any misstatements were made in the Offering Documents.
2. The only statements that survived this motion to dismiss fall within the third category and relate to competition with Microsoft.
3. The SAC fails to plausibly plead that the defendants' statements regarding ARR (annualized revenue run rate) were either false or misleading, as UiPath made ample disclosures regarding both the nature of the ARR metric and its limitations.
4. The plaintiff's allegations regarding ARR are dismissed because the calculation was based on amounts invoiced during a particular time period and warned against using this metric to predict future revenue.
5. The SAC's allegations regarding competition with Microsoft are vague and plead at best that UiPath lost some deals to Microsoft, which is not inconsistent with the statements by Dines cited above.

Overall, the court found that the plaintiff did not adequately plead a Section 11 claim, as there was no plausible allegation of material misstatements or omissions in the Offering Documents.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 18.54s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts from Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S, I conclude that the opinion states that:

* Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omission renders statements made misleading.
* The rule does not apply to "pure omissions," which occur when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence.
* Even a duty to disclose certain information does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b).
* Instead, the rule requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading."

Justification:

The opinion cites Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. 257, 259 (2024), which provides guidance on Rule 10b-5(b) and the concept of "pure omissions." The court in Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S applies this precedent to conclude that the defendants' statements regarding competition with Microsoft are not misleading under Rule 10b-5(b).

*Processing time: 13.96s | Retrieved chunks: 6 | Query complexity: simple | Adaptive k: 6 | Est. tokens: 1500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, it appears that on September 27, 2022, UiPath hosted an Analyst/Investor day during which Robert Enslin stated that "[w]e haven't been efficient in how we sell, and we aren't delivering the platform... in ways that clearly resonate with our customers."

The specific quote mentioned is from Robert Enslin's statement during the Analyst/Investor day on September 27, 2022.

**Q: What issues did the plaintiff raise about the ARR metric?**
*Processing time: 13.19s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the plaintiff raised several issues regarding the ARR (Annualized Revenue Run Rate) metric:

1. The invoiced amounts included revenue that might never be realized in future years, as customers may choose not to renew licenses.
2. The ARR was inflated because it included non-recurring revenue such as one-time fees for implementation and service.
3. The definition of ARR was misleading because UiPath described it as a "key metric" and a better indicator of its financial health than the GAAP metrics.

These issues were raised in the SAC (Statement of Alleged Claims) and are discussed in the Opinion excerpts provided.

**Q: How did UiPath allegedly mislead investors during the IPO?**
*Processing time: 22.29s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts, it appears that the SAC (Securities Class Action) alleges that UiPath misled investors during the IPO by making four sets of misrepresentations:

1. Statements concerning ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): The SAC claims that UiPath's statements about ARR were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial performance.
2. Statements concerning "land-and-expand" business model: The SAC alleges that UiPath's statements about its ability to expand its business and increase revenue from existing customers were misleading, as the company was actually experiencing difficulties in this area.
3. Statements regarding competitors, particularly Microsoft: The SAC claims that UiPath's statements about its competitive position and market share were misleading, as the company was struggling to compete with Microsoft and other rivals.
4. Risk factors identified in SEC filings: The SAC alleges that the risk factors disclosed by UiPath in its SEC filings were misleading because they did not accurately reflect the company's financial condition or business performance.

However, based on the excerpts provided, it appears that the court has dismissed some of these claims, finding that:

* The statements about ARR were not misleading, as UiPath warned investors not to rely solely on this metric and provided GAAP-compliant financial results.
* The statements about the "land-and-expand" business model were taken out of context and did not state a violation of securities laws.
* The risk factors disclosed by UiPath in its SEC filings were not misleading, as they accurately reflected the company's financial condition and business performance.

Therefore, it appears that the court has granted the motion to dismiss some of the plaintiff's claims, finding that UiPath did not mislead investors during the IPO.

**Q: What were the court's reasons for dismissing the Section 11 claims?**
*Processing time: 21.28s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the excerpts provided, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were time-barred. The plaintiff did not plead a plausible claim under Section 11, and the original complaint filed in September 2023 did not include a Section 11 claim. Therefore, the one-year statute of limitations period began when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the untrue statement or omission, which was after the filing of the original complaint.

The court also held that American Pipe tolling does not apply to revive a time-barred Section 11 claim. The doctrine only permits the substitution of a named plaintiff to cure a standing defect, but it does not permit the filing of an amended class action complaint containing a time-barred claim.

Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiff's reliance on cases permitting the substitution of a named plaintiff to cure a standing defect was misplaced, as those cases did not involve a time-barred claim. The court also distinguished the case of MYL Litig. Recovery I LLC v. Mylan N.V., which relied on American Pipe tolling to permit an individual plaintiff who had opted out of a class action to bring a time-barred claim under Section 18 of the Exchange Act.

In summary, the court dismissed the Section 11 claims because they were time-barred and did not meet the pleading requirements under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

**Q: What does the opinion say about Rule 10b-5 violations?**
*Processing time: 25.46s | Retrieved chunks: 10 | Query complexity: medium | Adaptive k: 10 | Est. tokens: 2500*

A: Based on the provided excerpts from Local 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S, here is my analysis:

The opinion discusses Rule 10b-5(b) and its application to the case at hand. The key points are:

1. Rule 10b-5(b) makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omission renders statements made misleading (Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab Partners, L.P., 601 U.S. 257, 259 (2024)).
2. The rule does not apply to "pure omissions," which occur when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence (Id. at 263).
3. Even a duty to disclose certain information does not automatically render silence misleading under Rule 10b-5(b) (Id. at 265). Instead, the rule requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading" (Id. at 264).

In the context of this case, the opinion notes that the plaintiff does not challenge the accuracy of UiPath's reported financial information and does not assert that the ARR figures appearing in the Company's SEC filings were false. Instead, the plaintiff argues that the ARR metric itself was "artificially inflated" for three reasons.

Therefore, based on these excerpts, I conclude that:

**Answer:** The opinion states that Rule 10b-5(b) requires identifying affirmative assertions before determining if other facts are needed to make those statements "not misleading." It also notes that the plaintiff's claims do not challenge the accuracy of UiPath's reported financial information and does not assert that the ARR figures appearing in the Company's SEC filings were false.

By November 6, seven applications to be appointed lead plaintiff had been filed. On December 1, Paul Severt was appointed as lead plaintiff."

Therefore, I would answer:

"There is no information in the provided excerpts about what happened on September 27, 2022."
