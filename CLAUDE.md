Let us continue with enhancements and come up with a plan to implement LLM Response Streaming
Please review the plan in README first
It is important that we develop a unit test for planned new functionality
build
and then do both unit and regression testing
Once all tests pass, we should remove any temporary file
I will also run an offline test then and we will wrap up by updating README
