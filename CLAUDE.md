Review code base and README.md to get a good understanding of the current state
Can you check that the test_baseline.py follows the exact same logic as is currently implemented?
I am seeing differences in quality of results.
Also, when I rerun this, it doesn't append to the top of results.md.  I have had to delete results.md to get it to share the latest results.
