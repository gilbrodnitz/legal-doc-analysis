Please review README and do a quick scan of the code base to understand current state
We will next focus on Querry response caching to complete Phase 1A

After implementation, develop and execute unit test, followed by regression testing
Update gitignore and devcontainer as needed
Finally remove any temporary files that you create and update README
In the end, confirm whether the code is ready to commit
