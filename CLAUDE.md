Review code base and README.md to get a good understanding of the current state
We are going to be implementing some of the High Priority fixes
Let us start with Semantic Chunking Improvement
Come up with a plan, execute it, develop new unit tests and then complete both unit and regression testing
Note run only 1 question in test_baseline.py for regression testing purposes (or ignore it)
Share feedback and whether it is ready for me to push into my GitHub repo or more testing is required
Update README.md
Shut down Ollama and other servers that you may need for your purposes at the end of the session
